<p>I avoid my family because they are at best begrudgingly accepting of who I am, and always abusive and manipulative. I haven’t spent any holidays with them since 2013, by choice, because I don’t feel safe doing so.</p>
<p>Still, though, I find myself desiring the familiar; I find not being around large groups of people during holidays, as I was for the vast majority of my life, unsettling and lonely. I miss the company of the handful of people I trusted there. I occasionally miss my abuser during these periods, and that scares the <i>fuck</i> out of me. I especially miss playing with the younger kids during the holidays.</p>
<p>To those who are unable to be with their family during the holidays because they are unaccepting of who you are, they are abusive and you had to leave to be safe, or any other reason:</p>
<p>You deserve companionship. You deserve to be surrounded by people that care about you, every time of year. You deserve to spend the holidays with those who are dearest to you. <b>You are worthy. You are loved. You are important.</b> Please don’t ever forget that.</p>
<p>There are people who care about you. There are people who want to be with you. You may be separated from them by distances you can’t close right now — cities, states, countries, continents, oceans — but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist.</p>
<p>It’s rough as hell, sometimes, but please take care of yourselves. You deserve that, too.</p>

  <h1 class="title">Comment: On Words and Assignment</h1>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>Words are political, there&#8217;s no way around this. Unless you&#8217;re inventing language on the spot, every time you open your mouth you have to accept that that with the noises your making comes centuries of meaning, use, and history. Try as you may, it&#8217;s inescapable even if your intention is not to offend or harken back to historical use.</p>
  <p>Because of this, writing articles about trans identity can be difficult. It&#8217;s hard to talk about ourselves when so many of the words we use have been used against us by cis people. Language can be a tool of oppression and, for our community, this was often the case. The slurs that have been used against us are obviously terrible, but even cis individuals in the medical community, masquerading as allies or friends, have been equally as shitty and oppressive. Understandably, the majority of the trans community has been pushing hard to move away from these terms, whether slurs or &#8220;science&#8221;.</p>
  <p>While writing about <a href="https://inatri.com/articles/deviations-in-masturbation-in-the-transgender-community/">masturbation</a>, the word choices became the hardest part of writing the article. I had conversations with individuals from a very specific subset of the trans community, all with similar genitals, but with different gender identities. To lump them all in the same category would be doing a violent disservice to them, however, to not be able to specify that only certain people were willing to talk to me would also let down the strength of the article. Because of this I made a compromise and used two acronyms that are not without controversy in the trans community: assigned male at birth (amab), and assigned female at birth (afab).</p>
  <p>The problem with these terms will be immediately apparent to a large number of trans people but in essence they combine three things I hate: shitty science, assumptions of sex based on genitals, and terms cis people appropriate for us. It is, in essence, the most politically correct way to say &#8220;birth sex&#8221;, while still being used to justify cis oppression, bigotry, and ignorance. It may be a softer way to say something incredibly shitty, but it&#8217;s still saying something incredibly shitty with all the garbage history that terms like &#8220;birth sex&#8221; and &#8220;x-to-x&#8221; bring.</p>
  <p>That&#8217;s not the whole story though, there is a second meaning to unpack. When I first heard amab and afab a few years ago, I heard it as a term trans people were using to describe themselves. In this context it was often used in a more self-deprecating manner. Assignment is dehumanizing, to tell someone they&#8217;re something they don&#8217;t identify as, against their will, is violent. Assignment is patronizing, unnecessary, is used as a gate-keeping tool, and is a huge hassle to change. When applied to ourselves, it serves as a little tongue in cheek reminder that the our doctors made a mistake we&#8217;ll spend the majority of our adult lives correcting, that cisnormativity is pervasive, and that the social construction of sex is a reality.</p>
  <p>Obviously, these terms are now more centred around the former than the latter, but it is still something descriptive of a subset of the trans community that had a similar starting point while not explicitly connecting genitals to gender and assuming a similar experience. I reluctantly used these terms however, but with an addition. When my editor suggested using &#8220;Coercively&#8221; in front of amab or afab, I immediately relished the thought. It was just icing on an already implied &#8220;fuck you&#8221; cake. Cis people could never re-appropriate the term without having to deal with the baggage calling themselves &#8220;coercive,&#8221; and implying that they too are continuing the violence.</p>
  <p>Hence, I felt justified using those variations of assignment terms in my first article about masturbation. I just wanted to clear up any misgivings I had with the language used in the article and explain why I used the terms I used. As a writer I&#8217;m always keenly aware of the use of language and it&#8217;s implications, but I&#8217;m also aware that this explanation would have been ungainly or irrelevant in the article itself. There&#8217;s always the nagging through, every time I publish something, that would I have to mount a defence to justify my word choice. Nobody has actually called me on my shit yet, but I wanted to do good by my sources to pre-emptively publish an explanation as to why I used those particular terms to refer to them, while unpacking and discussing the particular language. My trepidation is always that my words will lead to eventually being ostracised, so I&#8217;d rather have a pre-emptive discussion than face a backlash.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">Comment: On &#8220;Unconditional&#8221; Love and Support</h1>

<p>I was always told that I was loved and supported unconditionally. It wasn&#8217;t until later that I figured out that was a lie. Certainly, you could tell your children, or your significant other, that you love them unconditionally. But until they test your patience and test the limits of your love, you will never know exactly how unconditional your love is. So I wanted to write something on &#8220;unconditionality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unconditional love, unconditional support, is a lie. Of course there are conditions to everything, there should be, and it&#8217;s something we should admit to ourselves. All relationships are predicated on certain conditions, common examples of these are: mutual respect, not being an abuser, and reciprocation. Sometimes relationships are predicated on shared politics and understanding of the world, some are centred around mutual interests.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: &#8220;Why do I like this person?&#8221; About every reason you give is a condition for why you like, love, or support a person. When those conditions are not met it sours and harms the relationship. If I found out a friend of mine was transphobic, supported transphobic individuals, or had no respect for me, I&#8217;d cut them off. I have absolutely no qualms with ceasing communication with people that rub me the wrong way, where I see red flags, and where I begin to question why I liked them in the first place.</p>
<p>Saying love is unconditional is an outright lie, and does a huge disservice to anyone involved. There are ways to embrace your conditions, set high standards, and tell people why exactly you love and support them, without having to fall back on meaningless rhetoric.</p>
